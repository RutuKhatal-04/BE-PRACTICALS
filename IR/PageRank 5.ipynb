    "# PageRank Explanation:\n",
    "# PageRank is an algorithm developed by Google to rank web pages based on their importance.\n",
    "# It assigns a score to each webpage, indicating its importance based on the number and quality of links pointing to it.\n",
    "# The core idea is that a page is more important if it is linked to by other important pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Uses of PageRank:\n",
    "# PageRank is commonly used in search engines to rank search results, providing relevant and authoritative results.\n",
    "# It is also used in social network analysis, ranking academic papers, and identifying influential nodes in a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why BeautifulSoup:\n",
    "# BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for web scraping, making it easy to extract information from HTML and XML files.\n",
    "# It parses HTML content, making it simple to navigate, search, and modify the parsed HTML tree.\n",
    "# It is chosen here because it is easy to use and efficient for scraping simple HTML content.\n",
    "# Other libraries like Selenium are used for more complex, dynamic content (e.g., JavaScript-based content),\n",
    "# but BeautifulSoup is sufficient for scraping basic internal links from static HTML pages.\n",
